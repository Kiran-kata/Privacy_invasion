# Privacy Shield

Privacy Shield is a privacy-focused web app that uses on-device face detection to spot unauthorized viewers and instantly blur the screen, show a warning overlay, and optionally play an alert. It lets you register your face locally, tune sensitivity, and keep monitoring in the background with wake lock support—no face data is sent to any server.
